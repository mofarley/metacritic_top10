for table in topten.find_all("table"):

    "" so im going to have to do something for <tr> incrementation. ""

    for critics in table.find_all("th"):
        for critic in critics:
            list.append(critic.text)
    
    for films in table.find_all("td"):
        for film in films:
            list.append(film.text)


so here's the thing --> for every table row (<tr>) that is a critic name
I want to add just the following film data that is contained in a <tr> (because 
for some reason all of the critics and films are contained seperately within
table rows). So i want to increment in pairs where I'm kinda thinking like this:

    critics = total number of critics #(its like 300)
    total = all of the <tr>'s --> which is critics + film lists
    critic_count = 0

    while critic_count <= total:
        i = critic_count; i++; i <= critic_count + 2:
            temp_list.append(total[critic_count])
        final_list.append(temp_list)
        critic_count + 2
