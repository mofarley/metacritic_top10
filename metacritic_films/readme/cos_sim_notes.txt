So a problem that I kind of ignored is how critics will have
reviewed so many more films that the user does. This means
that when cosine similarity is calculated, there are a
high number of 0 scores that are filled in for users 
that will be scored against critic ranking for that film. 
--> would it be better to just compare films from the user
list (i.e skip films that critics rank but user doesn't) or
to try to figure out a way to expand the user list??


!! there are 2044 film ids in rankings db and 2072 in films db


FOR ZERO (NO USER RATING) FILTERING:
1. Return film_id's for titles in user_dict --> DONE!
2. Filter rankings.pd via film_id's from step 1 
3. I think that might be it?? --> test this in a copy of helpers.py s
